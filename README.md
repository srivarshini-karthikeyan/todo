# Technologies Used

NexusTask is developed using open web standards to ensure maximum compatibility and maintainability:

1. HTML5 for semantic structure and accessibility
2. CSS3 including Flexbox, Grid, and CSS variables for layout and theming
3. JavaScript (ES6+) with a modular, object-oriented architecture for interaction and data handling
4. Font Awesome for a consistent and professional icon set

# Architectural Overview

The application is built following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating logic, user interface, and data handling for better scalability and maintainability. It leverages an event-driven approach to handle user interactions and state changes efficiently. Styling is managed with CSS custom properties, which makes theming straightforward and centralized.
